# SimpleGPACalc
Fun little exercise to introduce myself to Angular 2!

The app will help students analyze the minimum and maximum GPA's that they can acquire, a sneak peak into on of the many things my full app will do once its done!

p.s. It is pretty bad on mobile... [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) is still in beta


To get help with running this locally with `angular-cli` use `ng --help` or go check out the [Angular-CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
